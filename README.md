# Darktable Launcher App

This is a very small app that adds an extension to the Photos app on macOS.
When you edit a photo in the Photos app, this extension lets you select
"Edit in darktable" and it will open the file in darktable for editing.

## Yes

This is probably my first serious app on macOS so there are definitely bugs
and I'm probably not doing everything correctly. Patches would be greatly
appreciated!

## Building

Theoretically, you can just do `xcodebuild`, then copy the app from the `build`
folder to your Applications folder and it should work (at least it seems to be
working for me).
